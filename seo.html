        <h1>What is SEO?</h1>
        <p>What is SEO? Ever wondered how search engines decide which websites top the results? SEO, or Search Engine
            Optimization, holds the key to unlocking this digital mystery. It’s not just about keywords; it’s a
            strategic approach to enhancing online visibility. </p>

        <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
        <p>SEO stands for “search engine optimization”. It’s a process that helps search engines understand your
            website’s content and make it easier for users to find your site. The goal of SEO is to increase the amount
            of relevant, high-quality content on your website, which can lead to more traffic from search engines.</p>
        <p>Here are some ways to improve your website’s SEO:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use relevant keywords: Include keywords in your titles, meta descriptions, and headlines.</li>
            <li>Use descriptive URLs: Use keywords in your URLs instead of just numbers.</li>
            <li>Use schema markup: This helps specify the meaning of your page’s content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Search engines use a process called crawling and indexing to organize the web’s information. Crawling
            involves reading content across the web, and indexing involves adding that content to their library. Search
            engines evaluate the content they crawl and index using over 200 factors. When someone searches, the search
            engine uses its index to provide relevant results.</p>
