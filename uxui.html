        <h1>UX Design vs UI Design</h1>
        <p>
            UX (user experience) and UI (user interface) are common words in the tech world. While they are linked
            closely, people often confuse the meaning of both terminologies with each other. In this article, we’ll
            explain the difference between UI and UX designs and much more about them. Let’s get started!
        </p>
        <img src="UX-UI.jpg" alt="UX & UI">
        <h2>UX (User Experience)</h2>
        <p>UX focuses on the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service. This includes how
            the user feels while using it, how easily they achieve their goals, and overall satisfaction. UX encompasses
            all aspects of the product, including its accessibility, usefulness, performance and usability.</p>
        <h3>The principles key for good UX</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Visibility: </span> need to optimize referencing upstream of the design project</li>
            <li><span>Accessibility: </span> create a site compatible with all different technical supports and mobile
                and touch terminals</li>
            <li><span>Attractiveness: </span> choose a design consistent with pleasant, useful, intuitive and practical
                ergonomics</li>
            <li><span>Ease: </span> ergonomics must facilitate the search for information</li>
            <li><span>Credibility: </span> showcase of the brand, the site must reassure and convince Internet users
            </li>
            <li><span>Efficiency: </span> Internet users must easily and easily find the answers to their questions</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>UI (User Interface)</h2>
        <p>The UI concerns the appearance and interactivity of a product. It focuses on the visual design and
            presentation of the elements a user interacts with (buttons, icons, menus, colors, typography). The goal of
            the UI is to make the interface attractive, intuitive and easy to use.</p>
        <h3>UI components</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Graphical elements: </span> Buttons, menus, icons, scroll bars, text fields, etc. All these
                elements must be easily understandable and intuitive to guide the user in their journey.</li>
            <li><span>Layout and structure: </span> The organization of elements must follow a logic that facilitates
                navigation. A good interface design should be structured so that users can accomplish their tasks
                efficiently and smoothly.</li>
            <li><span>Typography and colors: </span> The use of fonts, text sizes, color contrasts and visual layout
                helps make the interface attractive and functional.</li>
            <li><span>Responsiveness: </span> The interface must react immediately and smoothly to user actions (such as
                clicking a button, filling out a form, etc.). Subtle transitions and animations can help inform the user
                of changes taking place.</li>
            <li><span>Adaptability: </span> Today, interfaces must be responsive and able to adjust to different screen
                sizes, whether smartphones, tablets or computers.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The difference between UX & UI</h2>
        <img src="ux-ui-difference.png" alt="UX VS UI">
        <P>UI = A subset of UX. UI is about the user's appearance and immediate interactions with the interface. The
            visual design and interactive elements that a user interacts with.</P>
        <P>UX = includes the entire process from start to finish: from discovery of the product to its use, including
            after-sales service. UX is not limited to the interface, it also includes elements like the speed of the
            application, overall satisfaction or even the in-store experience.</P>
